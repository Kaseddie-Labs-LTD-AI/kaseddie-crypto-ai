Deployment Files
For a successful deployment on Netlify, you only need the following two files in your project folder:

index.html: Contains all the HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript for the application.

netlify.toml: The configuration file that tells Netlify how to build, serve, and secure your site.

‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally
To run the project on your local machine, you will need to run the frontend and backend separately.

1. Backend Server:

# Navigate to the server directory
cd /path/to/your/backend-folder

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
node server-clean.js
# The server will be running on http://localhost:3002

2. Frontend Application:

Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Important: Ensure the apiBase variable in the KaseddiePlatform class points to your local server (http://localhost:3002/api) for local development.
